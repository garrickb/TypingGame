Keyboard Warrior
==========

<strong>STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS</strong>

Keyboard Warrior is not your typical typing game. I enjoy typing and boast a pretty fast typing speed, but I have never had my typing skills challenge in an engaging way. It's abusrd that nobody has made a fun typing game that is free and available. This game will be fun for people of all ages that want to better their typing skills. Keyboard Warrior was influenced by Z-type ( http://phoboslab.org/ztype/ ) and The Typing of the Dead arcade game. In its final form I plan on having this game function much like a dungeon crawler,
but instead of just pressing a button to attack your enemies, you must skillfully type out words and sentences.
